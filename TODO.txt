
DOCS
----

- update visualizations

BUGS/ TESTS
-----------

- _source may not be available as part of a SearchHit (when fields restriction is provided, for example);
  this makes _source a bit nonsensical since you either have to request it explicitly or implicitly
  not request anything. We could request it if needed but it'd complicate parsing/ decoration quite
  a bit.

FEATURES
--------

- Unify HTTP GET/POST with/without HTTP body (after some discussion with Simon W.).
