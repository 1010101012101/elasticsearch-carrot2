
VERSION 1.1.0
=============

DOCS
----

BUGS/ TESTS
-----------

- _source may not be available as part of a SearchHit (when fields restriction is provided, for example);
  this makes _source a bit nonsensical since you either have to request it explicitly or implicitly
  not request anything. We could request it if needed but it'd complicate parsing/ decoration quite
  a bit.

FEATURES
--------

- add an action to return supported clustering algorithms.

- add support for GET requests.

PERFORMANCE/ ROBUSTNESS
-----------------------

- check for error resilience and propagation (invalid query request, for example).
- add a test case with yaml body (or other xcontent)
- performance implications and performance testing (threading inside actions/ dispatched actions)? 


REFACTORINGS/ ITCHES
--------------------

- add/move source() parsing from REST to the request builder/object.

- Should we limit or augment the search window somehow (so that the clustering takes place on, say, 100 top results,
  but the returned list is only the top-k)? 
  This is problematic from the technical POV (parsed SearchRequest doesn't expose the internal search request directly;
  uri parameters get injected as extraSource); in most cases the user will need all document references anyway to link
  them up from clusters. Leaving for now. The search query determines the number of documents (and the type of aggregation,
  etc.) to use.
